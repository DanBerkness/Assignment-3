I have an error in my GUI loop. If you enter into the super user switch case as a valid user, it will prompt you to choose from some options.

type: 2 to change password.
It will ask for the change, and then re-prompt you to log in. 
If you log in again as a super user, it wioll work.
if you type 3, it will prompt you to change passsword.
Again it will apply the change, and prompt you to log in again.

I believe the issue is with breaking out of the loop randomly.

Let me know what you think the problem may be!
